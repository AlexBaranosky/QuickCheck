------------------------------------------------------------------------------
MUST FIX BEFORE RELEASE:

* consider adding all QuickCheck1 flags (in particular: printing the number of test cases)

* remove unnecessary incompatibilities with QuickCheck1

* find consistent good names for functions (especially primed function names and callbacks)

* add complete Haddock information

* add more callback functions

* implement pre-test callbacks (add these as a top-level flag)

* batch script

* investigate what is wrong with reporting exceptions and see if it can be fixed

* make sure a cut-down version works for Hugs

* find a good principle to decide what to export and what not

* decide what to export in Test.QuickCheck

* consider introducing special wrapper modules for certain extensions (such as callbacks)

* what to do about Test.QuickCheck.Function? --> remove it from the distribution
  (because in conjunction it does not work well)

* Control-C should stop testing/shrinking instead of throwing an exception and
  making the tests fail

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
MAY FIX BEFORE RELEASE:

* fix monadic testing for ST (at least check if everything works again)

* Deriving arbitrary, coarbitrary, shrink

* Implement .&&. ("real" and), and possibly .||. (and .|. ?)

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
FIXED:

* implement callbacks

* Poly
